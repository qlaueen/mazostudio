            During my senior year at NYU, one of the classes I took was Software Engineering. This class was totally project-based, and one of the assignments was to create a full-stack web application using Flask, Python and MongoDB. My teammates and I decided to create a Craigslist clone, "Laigscrist", an application that would allow users to list items for sale. We were not allowed to use any authentification for this project, therefore we had to come up with a different strategy in order to make the listings safe. Using hash and salt, each user would have to create a PIN when creating a listing, which would be required for editing and deleting the posting.

            When I started my studies in UI and UX design, I saw in multiple articles that I should create a project for my portfolio with my dream client. One of my career aspirations is to work in the fashion industry as a developer, so I started to do some research on what fashion companies I would love to work with. I came across Dior's website, and it didn't take me long to realize that the home page was not user friendly. The link were confusing and there was little to no picture of the products in the home page. So, I decided to design a home page alternative for the Dior website. This project was my first Figma design.          </p>

            For my Software Engineering class, one of the projects I had to do was wireframe and prototyping using Figma. This project had as one of the objectives to understand how user stories are a powerful tool for software development. My teammates and I had to interview potential users of our thrift shop app, Thrift.it, which allowed us to understand their needs in the app. After that, we designed a wireframe and a prototype using Figma that can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/IQpFKlwu5TWv9OXSjnqMfN/dream-client-dior?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=2%3A3&viewport=189%2C297%2C0.11&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=3%3A56">here</a>.

            My teammates and I created a Python package that gets information about celebrities`s birthdays. This assignment was my first time working with creating a Python package, building it, testing it, distributing it, and using it. The project consists of a few functions that, when called, display the birthdays of the celebrities that were born in a specific date. One of the functions also will display celebrities and their correspondent zodiac signs. Although the topic of this assignment seem very simple, it was really useful to help me learn about unit testing and Python packages.        </p>
