              During my senior year at NYU, one of the classes I took was Software Engineering. This class was totally project-based, and one of the assignments was to create a full-stack web application using Flask, Python and MongoDB. My teammates and I decided to create a Craigslist clone, "Laigscrist", an application that would allow users to list items for sale. We were not allowed to use any authentification for this project, therefore we had to come up with a different strategy in order to make the listings safe. 
            </p>
            <h4>The Development</h4>
            <p>
              The first step into developing this project was to assign the roles for each participant of the team. We collectively decided who was going to work in each part of the project, and that was accomplished successfully by using the SCRUM framework. 
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my tasks was to create the wireframe and prototype for the application, which would later be used as a guide for the software development. To create the wireframe and the prototype of this project, I used Figma. You can find the file <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/xbOTz2ZaJ0f2uaEdnImhub/laigscrist?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A2&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2">here</a>. I designed this project with the mobile first system in order to make it responsible and accessible. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, my task was to develop the front-end templates of the application. Using a combination of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, we were able to develop a fully responsive application.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Challenges
            </h4>
            <p>
              One of the challenges we faced during development was finding a way to make this app without using authentification. We know for an application where users have their own posts, it would be necessary to create some form of user creation and an auth page, so that different users wouldn't be allowed to edit posts that weren't theirs. Auth pages, however, were not allowed in this assignment. So the solution we came up with was to add a PIN for each listing. The user creating the listing would add a PIN that would allow them to edit or delete the listing if necessary. It would also allow the original poster to reply to questions that other users have about their listings. The PINs were hashed into our database, adding an extra layer of privacy to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest challenge in this project was deploying it. After trying using a Virtual Private Server, Shared Hosting and my school servers, I decided to use Heroku to deploy the application. Deployment is not taught in depth enough in school, so I had to look for tutorials and articles on how to deploy a full-stack application.
