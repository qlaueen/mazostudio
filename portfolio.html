            This project is a photobooth app where NYU students receive a random prompt and are asked to take a photo of themselves with the prompt. The app then displays the photos of all the students that have used the platform. The app also allows users to upvote or downvote the created photos, comment on their favorites, sort between most liked and most recent and search by keyword. For this app we also implemented Dockerfiles to containerize it, and created unit tests and integration tests using GithubActions.

            This machine learning project involves creating a web app that displays a random quote and prompts the user to record a voice memo reading the quote. The app will then analyze the audio of the voice memo and display the stats of the recording, such as the time taken to read the memo, correct words spoken, total words spoken per second, correct words spoken per second and more. It also gathers the information by all the users that have used the platform and displays the average stats of all the users.             For this app we also implemented Dockerfiles to containerize it, and created unit tests and integration tests using GithubActions.

            During my senior year at NYU, one of the classes I took was Software Engineering. This class was totally project-based, and one of the assignments was to create a full-stack web application using Flask, Python and MongoDB. My teammates and I decided to create a Craigslist clone, "Laigscrist", an application that would allow users to list items for sale. We were not allowed to use any authentification for this project, therefore we had to come up with a different strategy in order to make the listings safe. Using hash and salt, each user would have to create a PIN when creating a listing, which would be required for editing and deleting the posting.

            My teammates and I created a Python package that gets information about celebrities`s birthdays. This assignment was my first time working with creating a Python package, building it, testing it, distributing it, and using it. The project consists of a few functions that, when called, display the birthdays of the celebrities that were born in a specific date. One of the functions also will display celebrities and their correspondent zodiac signs. Although the topic of this assignment seem very simple, it was really useful to help me learn about unit testing and Python packages.        </p>
